Revision history for HTTP-Server-Simple-Dispatched

0.06    Mon March 24
        301 redirects from unslashied urls will now properly redirect, and we
				no longer clear headers, like ever.

0.05    Fri March 21
        Finally uninstalled Test::HTTP and tracked down the test bug.  I
        really hope this is the last time I have to fix this.

0.04    Thu March 20
        Fixed some errors in the tests - should skip properly for synopsis if
        Test::HTTP isn't installed.  Also fixed a bug in static().

0.03    Fri March 14
        Request should now actually read content bodies, which it did not
        before.  It doesn't precisely conform to the HTTP standard, but that's
        acceptable for the time being.

0.02    Automatic setting of Content-Length header to avoid some sticky
        problems where the trailing request newline was treated as part of the
        body by most user-agents.

0.01    Tue March 11
        First release.
